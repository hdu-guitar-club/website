# Equipment Usage

## Public Guitar Usage Rules

Public acoustic guitars and electric guitars can be freely used by members inside and outside the rehearsal room. Please take good care of the equipment when using it.

### Usage Guidelines

1. **Return in Time**: After using public guitars, return them to their original place in a timely manner to ensure items are properly stored
2. **Self-Tuning**: If the public guitar is out of tune, members can download a tuning app to tune it themselves
3. **Bring Your Own Accessories**: Members are advised to bring their own capos and picks; the rehearsal room does not provide dedicated accessories

## Speakers and Related Equipment

### STAGEPAS 600BT Speaker

The rehearsal room is equipped with a STAGEPAS 600BT speaker, which members can use on their own.

> PA is short for speaker. For related operations, you can consult senior Guitar Association members offline.

### Usage Guidelines

1. **Turn Off Power**: After using the speaker, remember to turn off the power to develop good usage habits
2. **Seek Help**: If you don't know how to use the speaker or PA equipment, or need to borrow various connection cables, feel free to consult senior Guitar Association members online or offline at any time

## Private Instrument Usage

### Pre-Usage Guidelines

For private instruments such as keyboards and electric guitars that are placed in instrument cases and require power, other members **must obtain the instrument owner's permission** before using them.

### Post-Usage Guidelines

After using private instruments, make sure to:

1. Turn off the power normally
2. Unplug the cables
3. Return the instrument to its original place

## Drum Set

The drum set is public equipment in the rehearsal room. Drummers coming to practice are advised to **bring their own drumsticks**.
