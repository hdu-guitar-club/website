# Newcomer Guide

## Instrument Learning

### Group Communication

At the Newcomer Assembly, the Guitar Association will create dedicated groups for communication based on instrument types:

- Guitar learners join the guitar group
- Drum learners join the drummer group
- Other instruments follow the same principle

This facilitates communication and learning among enthusiasts of the same instrument.

### Getting Started Suggestions

1. **Understand Basic Knowledge**
   - Newcomers are advised to first understand some basic music knowledge on their own
   - Clarify their own learning needs for the instrument (for example, when learning acoustic guitar, whether they prefer strumming and singing or fingerstyle)

2. **Self-Learn Basic Techniques**
   - On platforms such as Bilibili and Xiaohongshu, you can self-learn basic techniques such as chord transitions

3. **Persistent Practice**
   - The entry difficulty for any instrument is not high
   - But to master the instrument and even perform on stage requires persistent practice

4. **Balance Academics**
   - While practicing instruments and participating in rehearsals, you need to balance your academics and not delay normal learning

### Learning Support

If you encounter problems with instrument learning, you can consult senior Guitar Association members in the corresponding instrument communication group at any time. Questions can be answered both online and offline.

## Band Formation

### Formation Prerequisites

Newcomers can actively socialize and get to know more classmates around them to prepare for band formation.

### Formation Requirements

- Members can form bands based on their own music styles
- There are no restrictions on band members; you can find classmates from the same year or senior students

### Band Review

After the band completes internal discussions and determines information such as members, style, and band name, it needs to be reviewed by Guitar Association leaders.

**Review Leaders**: Senior Brother Ganggang, Senior Sister Xiaohui

### Dedicated Management

After the band passes the review, the Guitar Association will create a dedicated newcomer band management group to include all newcomer bands for unified management.

## Message

We hope one day you can stand on the stage of the GR Music Festival, or an even bigger music stage!

Welcome to come to the Student Activity Center South A105 rehearsal room often and actively participate in club activities.
